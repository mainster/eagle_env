This is a wishlist of ULPs or system mods for Eagle.

CORE:
- Shortcut modifiers. Ability to modify shortcut options from menu (or other shortcuts)
	

- LAYER: Create a running history of display settings to enable BACK and FORWARD. Just like web browser.

	

- DISPLAY:
	-> Highlight layer focus. Currently a thin dotted border.
	-> On dialog OK, change layer to last in focus. Or at least keep tools from turning on hidden layers.
		- Keep a history and use the last changed layer for the layers still visible.

- DISPLAY replacement ulp:
	-> Layer change on exit.
	-> Checkboxes for show (can it do an apply when changing checkboxes?)
	-> Highlight modes radio items. No fill, semi-fill, solid-fill.
	-> Grayscale mode to remove color (setup grayscale section of palette)
	-> Per project display aliases

ULP:

- Copy group to next layer ulp.

- Functions to handle cfgget and set and would do the type conversions. (real to str, int to string, etc)

DONE - Found trace-layer.ulp - Ulp to Solo layer and cycle for single layer checking.

- Schematic context item "Add to brd group". Would add selected part to the current board group.

- Display presests which use layer fill changes to create high contrast modes.
	- Started with scr files to experiment with fill settings

- GROUP INFO: Ulp to run info on group. Group does not allow group activation of INFO tool. I think I remember seeing a ulp somewhere.

- Context menu for polygon to pour individual.
	-> Pour Manager: 

- UlP to hide all layers (SET USED) that do not contain any objects.

Set shortcut to PRESET launcher.
	Set preset option from text menu (stored in eaglerc.user)
	- CFGTOGGLE Usage idea. Set preset options from POUR menu, that way pour preset (F5) can be changed from the menu. (pour gnd or only v nets).
