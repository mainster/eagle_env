Version: 0.1beta 05/12/17
Basic operation. Rotate group by increment. When launched from shortcut, rotates around origin at mouse cursor. Clear mark using 'mark ;'

To-Do Feature List:
1) Add argument handling (separate shortcuts or 45/90 selection.)
2) Rotate using polar grid (by angle)
3) Option for fixed origin (or set origin with alternate shortcut)
	Use MARK (x y) to set mark for rotate origin at 'WINDOW (@)'
	- Or could map MARK to shortcut.
